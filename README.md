performs ship optimizations in Aurora 4x

Please don't use this tool if it'll ruin your fun. If you're not sure if it will, then I can assure you without a doubt you will wish you never picked this up. However, if you can keep yourself from steamrolling NPRs with your ultra-optimized battlecruisers, feel free to use this and help me with the math.

Most of the math is kinda sketchy (if it's even been done!). I'm begging you, on my hands and knees, please help if you have any idea how things like armor values or magazine capacity are calculated.
